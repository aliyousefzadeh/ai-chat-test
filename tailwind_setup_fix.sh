# You're experiencing a rare issue where tailwindcss is listed in node_modules but has no binary.
# Let's fix it step-by-step:

# 1. First, uninstall it to clean everything:
npm uninstall tailwindcss

# 2. Reinstall it **explicitly with CLI** package
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest tailwindcss-cli@latest

# 3. Check if the binary is created
ls -l node_modules/.bin/tailwindcss

# 4. If binary appears, then initialize the config
npx tailwindcss init

# If `tailwindcss-cli` doesnâ€™t exist, install Tailwind via their recommended method instead:
# (This uses the standalone executable for Tailwind)

# Optionally, download Tailwind CLI binary directly (if npm fails repeatedly):
# curl -o tailwindcss https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest/download/tailwindcss-linux-x64
# chmod +x tailwindcss
# sudo mv tailwindcss /usr/local/bin/
# tailwindcss init

# This guarantees the CLI works, regardless of npm weirdness.
